# 🚗 Uber Traffic Congestion Prediction (Internship Project)

## 📌 About the Project

Ride-sharing services like Uber have revolutionized transportation by offering convenient and affordable mobility. However, with growing urbanization, **traffic congestion** has become a critical bottleneck — affecting both ride efficiency and customer satisfaction.

This Menternship project focuses on solving the widespread issue of **urban traffic congestion** by predicting hourly traffic volumes at various road junctions using historical traffic data.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> Develop a predictive model to accurately forecast **hourly traffic volumes** at different road junctions based on historical data.

You will analyze traffic patterns, identify peak hours, compare congestion across junctions, and ultimately train and evaluate machine learning models to improve Uber's operational efficiency.
